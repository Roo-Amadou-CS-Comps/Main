Roo:

- I have a website set up! It's just HTML and PHP, no CSS or anything fancy. The background is Apache2 and Nginx. 
- There are two methods for getting in - one that uses basicauth built in to the browser, and one that uses a PHP script. 
- There's some DOS protection, that is built in and enabled in Apache. I've done the config for that. 

- My next big thing is containerizing it and then adding in login-attempt logging. After that, we're getting into benchmarking and improving the spraying tool
- I like to think at least with the website, we're getting closer to minimum viable product.
