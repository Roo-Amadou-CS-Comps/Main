1. Look into https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/htpasswd.html
2. Let's first start implementation in python, then try C
3. A good word list: https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists
4. Print in red that no username / password combination was found for a page when the thing is exhausted
5. Print in green the found username / password combination
6. Differentiate between a basicauth / html / php login that simply gives access to the page, and one that actually gives access to another page
   (context: we had a php login translated to HTML that effectively allowed a user to enter a wrong username and password combination;
    however, RA Spray would consider that combination correct because after the failure the page would return a 200 response that simply
    redirected to the actual page that's requesting the usernmae and password (giving you the chance to enter another combination), and not 
    access to the page it was protecting. we need to fix that to consider both situations)
