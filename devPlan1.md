## **Project Description**

We effectively aim to design and implement a password spraying tool targeting SSH and HTTP authentication mechanisms. 

Password spraying: A technique where an attacker tries a common / many password(s) against a / many username(s) to avoid account lockouts. Our project involves:

- Setting up a controlled server environment with SSH and HTTP authentication.
- Developing a password spraying application similar to Hydra or Brutus.
- Implementing techniques to bypass time-based authentication restrictions and evade detection.
- Analyzing the effectiveness of the tool and exploring mitigation strategies.
