Amadou and Roo, CS Comps 2024/25

We plan on implementing a version of Hydra or other password-spraying applications, to attack SSH and HTTP sites. This will involve setting up our own server to attack, and implementing spraying functions. 

Learning goals:
- Understand smart/safe techniques for server/website administration
- Efficient use of SSH and HTTP protocols
- Understand the use and limitations of password spraying tools

Development goals:
- Create server to attack
 - Should have SSH, HTTP authentication
 - Variety of access user/password combinations

- Create application similar to Hydra or Brutus
 - Brute force authentication over SSH or HTTP
 - Not pre-hashing
 - Bypassing/tricking time-based authentication

Secondary goals:
- Server RDP
- Microsoft AD or some other directory? 
- How to set up systems to make them more secure
 - Frequency/traffic analysis
 - AI/ML?
- Various elevations of access - admin, user, viewer

Streeeeeetch goals:
- Multiple device spraying - DDoS, but distributed spraying
- VPN/other techniques to spread out attacks to make it harder to block

Basic division of labor:
- Roo sets up, Amadou breaks
